The order of this list depicts the order I read them in rather than how much I enjoyed the books. It's difficult to compare content from different genres. I've added book descriptions from Amazon in the beginning to explain what the book is about, and a concise review follows shortly after.

These reviews are raw thoughts post reading converted into sentences rather than in-depth summaries or explanations of what the book is or what it tries to convey. I do however hope that my short reviews convince you to read these books and hopefully you come to like them as much as I did. If you have read or end up reading any of these books and share my excitement or want to talk more about them, send me a message!

Another note: I am not a researcher and I haven't validated every fact in these books nor are the facts in these books things I believe readers should blindly trust. But, I think it's worth trusting the general idea, and gaining a new understanding and perspective of life and health.

### Breath

**Author: Jamesh Nestor**

**Description:**

A journalist investigates the science of breathing and its impact on health, performance, and well-being, uncovering ancient practices and modern research that challenge conventional wisdom and offer transformative benefits.

**What I Enjoyed:**

I had never thought so deeply and actively about how I breathe and the impact of breathing until I read this book. I now very consciously
try to fix my breathing when I feel stressed, or when I'm doing any physical activity, or even while I am just working at my desk. It's had a lasting and profound impact on me and I genuinely think it's a book worth reading for everyone.

The entire book is a journey alongside the author - the chronology and flow of the book makes it very engaging and I found it hard to put down.

You learn about the impact of how we breathe on our evolution, how horribly most of us currrently breathe vs how we should be breathing, how different breathing techniques have had an incredible impact on athletes, a variety of incredible breathing techniques and so much more.

Quoting the author here because I agree: "You will never breathe the same again."

### The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now

**Author: Meg Jay**

**Description:**

This book is about how the twenties are the most transformative decade of adulthood and how to make the most of it

**What I Enjoyed:**

A great great read. Everyone in their 20s or approaching their 20s should read this.

The book is a collection of therapist conversations and thus a lot of chapters feel like a therapist conversation that you should have had because you sometimes relate to the character the therpaist is speaking with. If it's not you, then you definetely know someone that is the main character of the chapter. This is the case for most chapters and I think that relatability to yourself or people you know is what drives the perspective home a lot of times.

It puts life and your 20s into a new perspective. For me, it validated a lot of choices I made, and struggles I have faced or my friends have faced. It was simultaneouly a call to action, and a validating call to calm down because you don't have to know everything and be everything yet.

### Why We Sleep

**Author: Mathew Walker**

**Description:**

A groundbreaking exploration of the vital role sleep plays in our physical and mental well-being, backed by cutting-edge scientific research.

**What I Enjoyed:**

This was an incredible book as well. Majority of the people today either do not sleep well or do not sleep enough. This book will definetely inform you and scare you into why you really should be making sleeping well your primary priority.

I will note that I feel like the negative aspects were focused on super heavily which made the end-to-end reading experience a little too dommsday-like so I kind of skimmed at some point when it got too much, but I do think that it was important to the book that it was that way so I donâ€™t blame the author.

The book is organized really well. I recommend reading it in order, but you could also pick it up and switch between sections that excite you, like learning about dreams or certian sleep disorders, or maybe just reading the section on techniques to fix your sleep.

**Honorable Mentions**:

I dove into the Brandon Sanderson book universe and read _Way of Kings_ and _Words of Radiance_ from the Stormlight Archive series. His books can seem daunting at times because of their size, but once you are in the universe, every book is a long, engaging TV show in your head.
